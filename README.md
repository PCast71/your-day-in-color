##Usage:
Upon starting up the application you will see a 'standard' workday layout 9-5 like Dolly Parton sang about. Within these time blocks you can add and save notes regarding what you have in store throughout the day. You can also save these tasks to your local storage so it does not disappear when refreshing. It is color coded depending on the time of day as well.
